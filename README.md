# Code2040Challenge
Code 2040 Coding Challenge 2015-16. A set of four coding problems to be solved using APIs and a language of your choice. 

I used Python for the simplistic elegance it allows when solving coding problems.

During this challenge, I learned how to use Python for executing HTTP Requests, how to use JSON for encoding human-readable data efficiently, and how ISO 8601 datestamps work.
